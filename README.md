### Project Description
Women-Safety-Alert-System is a real-time web application that captures live GPS coordinates and utilizes an automated 30-second safety timer to bridge the gap between victims and authorities. It ensures a fail-safe escalation to a Police Dashboard if an emergency is not deactivated with a secure PIN, providing a digital lifeline when every second counts.

### The Problem statement
Existing SOS systems often fail if the victim's phone is snatched or they are silenced, as they require continuous manual action to send help. Women-Safety-Alert-System improves this by using a "Fail-Safe Deactivation" model: once the SOS is triggered, an alert is guaranteed to reach the police unless the user enters a secure PIN to cancel it within 30 seconds. This ensures that even if a device is disabled during a struggle, the server-side timer continues the countdown to protect the victim.

### The Solution
The Solution: Fail-Safe Server-Side Escalation
Our system replaces unreliable manual alerts with a "Presumed Danger" model. Once triggered, a 30-second countdown runs on a cloud server—not the phone—ensuring that if a device is snatched or destroyed, the alert cannot be stopped. Help is dispatched to the Police Dashboard automatically unless the victim enters a secure Private PIN to prove they are safe.

## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: One-Tap Emergency Trigger: A high-visibility SOS button that instantly captures the victim's precise GPS coordinates using the HTML5 Geolocation API, ensuring zero time is wasted during an incident.
- 
- Feature 2: Fail-Safe Server-Side Timer: A 30-second countdown that runs on the cloud server rather than the local device; this ensures that even if the attacker destroys the phone, the alert will still be sent once the time expires.
- 
- Feature 3:PIN-Protected Deactivation: A secure cancellation mechanism that requires a pre-registered private PIN to stop an alert, preventing attackers from forcing a victim to cancel the emergency signal.
- 
- Feature 4: Live Police Dashboard: A dedicated interface for law enforcement that displays active alerts in real-time, featuring one-click integration with Google Maps for immediate navigation to the victim's last known location.
